<{IMAGE:image_1}>

If WSL integration keeps stopping with exit code 1, try these in order.

**Toggle the DNS cache service**

This [Reddit fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/p98xq6/docker_failed_to_start_exit_code_1/) works for some users:

```bash
reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache" /v "Start" /t REG_DWORD /d "4" /f
```

Restart Windows, then re-enable it:

```bash
reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache" /v "Start" /t REG_DWORD /d "2" /f
```

Restart Windows again.

**Switch Docker Desktop to Linux containers**

Right-click the Docker tray icon and choose "Switch to Linux containers" if it isn't already.
